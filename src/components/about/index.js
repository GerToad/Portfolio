                Hi, I am Gerardo Palmieri. Current full-stack developer from MÃ©xico. I spend my time on personal projects and learning more about full-stack and how to improve my skills. I am passionate about building accessible, user-friendly websites and web applications. My skills include HTML, CSS(SASS), Javascript (ES6), React, GIT, Github, PHP Symfony and many others. However, I am constantly learning and open to new technologies. If you think I would be a great fit for your team feel free to contact me so we can chat.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a self-taught developer I am a fast, effecient and resourceful learner. With my abilities and skills I am able to solve problems quickly. In my free time I enjoy spending time learning about other things like science, politics, languages(german and italian) and listening music.
